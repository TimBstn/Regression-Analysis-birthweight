    "In our first assignment in Machine Learning, we try to predict the birthweight of newborn babies and give advice to the mothers what to do in pregnancy. There are several factors playing a role for the weight, for example the amount of cigarettes smoked by the mother. The factors and impacts are explained later on.\n",
    "Our model cannot predict the birthweight perfectly, as other factors play an important role too. The authors in <a href=\"https://www.marsden-weighing.co.uk/blog/factors-affect-baby-birth-weight\">this website</a> state that for example heights of mother and father, the number of babies and length of pregnancy are important factors for the birthweight.

    "Again, the father's age has an impact on the health of the baby. <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/10/older-fathers-associated-with-increased-birth-risks.html\">Hanae Armitage</a> shows, that fathers who are 45 or older were 14 percent more likely to have a child born prematurely, and men 50 or older were 28 percent more likely to have a child that required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The author shows that 35 seems to be the critical age, but again I set the border to 40 and older. The correlation matrix does not show such a big impact compared to the mother's age, however it seems to be important if the dad is over 40.\n",
    "As the age seems to play an important role, I also created columns of the total age of both parents (mother's age + father's age) and if both parents are over 40. The correlation matrix suggests, that the total age of both parents is important for the babies weight."

That is supported by the authors of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6519047/\">this paper</a>, which claim that there is a casual link between education and health, but not as significant as expected. This effect is also shown in the correlation matrix, as the values are low compared to the age.

The authors on <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/ensuring-healthy-births-prenatal-support/\">this website</a> recommend 13 to 14 prenatal visits with a starting date not later than 10 weeks after pregnancy. In comparison to the authors claim, the number of visits and begin of prenatal care do not seem to have such a big impact on the babies weight. As proposed on the website, I checked if the prenatal care began late (after month 2), which impacts the bodyweight. As mentioned before, our women tend to go to the prenatal care 12 times, that is why I set the border of low to 11. Again, the number of visits does not seem to have an influence, only if the woman went to less times."

The boxplots show a negative trend which is also confirmed in the correlation matrix. It also seems that drinking has a worse impact than smoking.
